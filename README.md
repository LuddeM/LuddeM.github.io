# Personal Website (Built Version)

Built version of my personal website GitHub repository (private). Can be visited at [luddem.github.io](https://luddem.github.io/#/), where I showcase my CV, some projects I have been working on, as well as some more information about me.

Created using **Vue.js** and **TypeScript** using the **Bulma** CSS framework for styling.

### Some Future Work

- Exporting content as PDF, based on active filters.
- Projects that can be tested live, with links.
- Support more languages, like German and Swedish.
- Using MarkDown or Word-files as basis for the text content, instead of .json files.
- Dark/Light Themes.
